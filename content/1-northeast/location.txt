## Staff tip jar

So we've received several messages from people wondering if there's any way they might show some support for Grumpy's staff during these trying days. First off, we're gushing. Thank you SO much. This really means a lot to us! We try to operate Grumpy's with the idea that it's a family as well as a business. A true public house, an extension of the neighborhood. And when we get requests like this it really means the world to us. So we went ahead and sent up a (link:https://www.gofundme.com/f/grumpy039s-ne-family-tip-jar text:virtual “tip jar”) you can contribute to. We obviously won't be keeping any of it, 100% will go to the staff and their families. We know not everyone can afford to spread it around and we totally understand. Take care of you and yours first! We sincerely hope you're all healthy and comfortable. And thanks again everybody! Can't wait to see you all after detention!
