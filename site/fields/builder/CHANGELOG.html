        <h1 id="1-1-0">1.1.0</h1>
<ul>
<li>added support for snippets to preview the content of the builder entries inside the panel listing</li>
<li>replaced the modal as a container for the edit form. Kirby Builder now uses inline forms, that replace the entries&#39; preview during edit mode</li>
<li>got rid of the table style as the builder fieldsets don&#39;t have to have comparable field sets. Therefore it was kind of pointless to display the content in a table</li>
<li>The buttons to add an entry are no longer hidden behind a dropdown field but visible directly under the builder field</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="1-0-0">1.0.0</h1>
<ul>
<li>the builder entries inside the panel now have a class that coresponds to the field set name, e.g. the entry of the fieldset <code>bodyText</code> will have the class <code>builder-entry-bodytext</code>. This class can be used in a custom panel css to give these entries specific stylings.</li>
</ul>
